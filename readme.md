# scripts4fun
Yes. Just a random set of "just for fun" scripts that I made when I'm just bored.

# Proposed ideas (known as WIP)  (~~not wedding proposal~~)
- Harvey Norman radio ad last sentence generator
  - WHY THIS SCRIPT? they literally just bought 7 slots of ads in Malaysian radio stations just to say that the promotion will be ended at the next day, dude
  - (This Python script grabs the week name (example Monday) and add 1 day ahead, so it will print out "Hurry! Sale must end (next day week name)!")
