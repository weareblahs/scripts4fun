| Harvey Norman radio ad last sentence generator | they literally just bought 7 slots of ads in Malaysian radio stations just to say that the promotion will be ended at the next day, dude | This Python script grabs the week name (example Monday) and add 1 day ahead, so it will print out "Hurry! Sale must end (next day week name)!" | Idea from my dad | [goharveynormango.py](https://github.com/weareblahs/scripts4fun/raw/main/goharveynormango.py) |
| Redirects for Google school-related websites to school accounts | My PC's browser has 2 accounts logged in - one is my personal account, and one is my school account. Everytime when I get in into a Google Meet link (or Google Classroom), I have to change accounts | This configuration for the [Redirector Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd) redirects both Google Meet and Google Classroom links from first user (`u/0 or authuser=0 for Meet`) to second user (`u/1 or authuser=1`). Users can modify which account by modifying the `u/* or authuser=*` part of the link in the JSON file. To use it, download [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd), Go to the Chrome extension page, then click "Import" then import the file that you just downloaded. | | [GoogleSchoolRedirects.json](https://github.com/weareblahs/scripts4fun/raw/main/GoogleSchoolRedirects.json)
| Guess The Random Wikipedia Article | | Command line-based Wikipedia article guesser which uses Wikipedia API to parse `Special:Random` and get a random sentence from the article. | WIP |
| "Snellen Eye Test, HTML, Sans-serif" (2024, black and white text on mixed media) | Since most people have headers included as the basic HTML stuff, I decided to do it due to an illusion of "Hello World" in different size | Open it in your browser directly as this is an static HTML webpage. Remeber to right click on the file name and click on "Save as..." as GitHub usually just show raw files as its original code and does not render HTML | | [HTMLEyeTest.html](https://github.com/weareblahs/scripts4fun/raw/main/HTMLEyeTest.html)
